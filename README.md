# React Native-Expo Starter Kit

This project serves as a boilerplate for a managed workflow [Expo](https://expo.io) application.

This is an opinionated starter kit for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)-[Expo](https://expo.io) projects to help kick start mobile applications development.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/arjayosma/react-native-simple-starter-kit.git`

2. Install all project dependencies

   `npm install`

3. Start development
4. Start the application

   `expo start`

## Features

## Dependencies

These are the project dependencies that I believe are going to be useful during development of any application.

You may add or remove existing dependencies as per your need. Listed below are the dependencies without the `expo`, `react`, and `react-native` dependencies.

1. [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) (`axios`)
   - A Promise based HTTP client.
   - This can be used for calling REST services for your application.
2. [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) (`native-base`)
   - A cross-platform UI components library for React Native.
   - This library simplifies the creation of UI components and screens.
3. [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (`prop-types`)
   - Run typechecking on the props of your React Native components.
   - It provides a range of validators to help check the values being passed around.
4. [React Native Extended Stylesheet](https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet) (`react-native-extended-stylesheet`)
   - Abstracts styles from the different components and elements.
   - This library is a drop-in replacement for the built-in `StylSheet` class of React Native.
